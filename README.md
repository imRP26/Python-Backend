## This repo is basically an attempt from my side to explore as much as possible about backend dev.

### SETUP steps in my system (MAC) :-
- IDE used -> VSCode.
- Created a venv to isolate the (Python) libraries used specifically for this repo!
- Continual updation of the daywise tasks that I set up for myself.
- Will be adding a Notion web link soon for error debugging during the journey!
